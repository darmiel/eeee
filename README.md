# EEEE

EEEE* is a tiny framework for simple console input of values, which I wrote mainly for exercises of
the university, because here often simple inputs with a scanner are needed, and I did not want to
rewrite them again and again.

Also, I didn't use any existing frameworks, because apparently we are only allowed to use
self-written code in the exams, and so I am allowed to use this mini-framework in the exams.

**NOTE:** This framework is ab-so-lutely not suitable for production use. It should only serve for
practice. Also, definitely not type-safe.

*) To be honest, I've already forgotten the meaning of the abbreviation. But it was certainly
perfect!
